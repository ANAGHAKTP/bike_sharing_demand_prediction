# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting bike sharing demand using machine learning techniques. The project aims to analyze historical bike sharing data, extract relevant features, and build predictive models to estimate the number of bikes rented at different times.

## Project Overview

Accurate prediction of bike sharing demand can help urban planners and bike sharing operators optimize resource allocation, improve user experience, and reduce operational costs. This project leverages machine learning to forecast demand using features such as weather conditions, date/time, and holidays.

## Dataset

- *Source:* [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://github.com/ANAGHAKTP/bike_sharing_demand_prediction/blob/main/1730285261-SeoulBikeData.csv)
- *Description:* The dataset contains hourly rental data, weather information, and timestamp features.

## Features

Typical features used for prediction include:
- Date and time (hour, weekday, month, year)
- Holiday and working day indicators
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather category)
- Rental counts (casual, registered, total)

## Modeling

The repository provides scripts for:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Prediction and visualization of results

## Getting Started

1. *Clone the repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANAGHAKTP/bike_sharing_demand_prediction.git
   cd bike_sharing_demand_prediction
